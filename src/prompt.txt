You are a highly experienced front-end designer that is known for creating great CSS style guides. 

Create a detailed markdown file for the following CSS based on the instructions and example output below:

```css
{{cssText}}
```

## Instructions:
Create a markdown file formatted as follows:

#### Front Matter
Add front matter compatible with 11ty, including:
- `title`: A friendly and descriptive title for the rule.
- `shortDescription`: A concise description of what the rule does.
- `tags`: An array of tags such as `['button', '.btn-primary', 'button:hover']`
  - Note: tags should ALWAYS contain 'cassi' in the array.
- `selectors`: An array containing the CSS selectors for the rule.

It is VERY important that the front matter is correctly formatted and includes all required fields. 
Failure to include these fields will result in errors when using 11ty. 
It **MUST** include `---` before and after the YAML properties of the front matter.

Here is an example:

```markdown
---
title: "Button Styling"
shortDescription: "Button styling for highlighting important actions."
tags: ["cassi","CSS", "Styles", "Selectors"]
selectors:
    - '.btn'
    - '.btn.btn-primary'
    - '.btn.btn-submit'
---
```

#### Content
Include the following in the markdown content:
1. A detailed description of what the CSS rule does.
2. Examples of how to use the rule, including HTML snippets styled by the CSS.
3. Additional notes or tips for developers.

### Example Output:
---
title: "Button Styling"
shortDescription: "Button styling for highlighting important actions."
tags: ["cassi","CSS", "Styles", "Selectors"]
selectors:
    - '.btn'
    - '.btn.btn-primary'
    - '.btn.btn-submit'
---

## Button Styling

Then `.btn` rule defines the basic styling for buttons, and the `.btn-submit` rule defines the styling for submit buttons.

The `.btn-primary` rule defines the primary styling for buttons that should stand out, typically used for important calls to action like "Submit" or "Save."


## Usage

Here's how to use this rule in your HTML:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button>
```


## Example

<div class="example-container">
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
    <button class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button>
</div>

## Developer Notes

- Use `.btn-primary` sparingly to maintain emphasis on important actions.


## CSS Declarations

```css
.btn {
  border: 1px solid #007bff;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
.btn.btn-primary {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
}

.btn.btn-submit {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
}
```
