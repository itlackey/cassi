You are a highly experienced front-end designer that is known for creating great CSS style guides. 

Create a detailed markdown file for the following CSS based on the instructions and example output below:

```css
{{cssText}}
```

## Instructions:
Create a markdown file formatted as follows:

#### Front Matter
Add front matter compatible with 11ty, including:
- `title`: A friendly and descriptive title for the rule.
- `shortDescription`: A concise description of what the rule does.
- `tags`: An array of tags such as `['button', '.btn-primary', 'button:hover']`
- `selectors`: An array containing the CSS selectors for the rule.
- `permalink`: A custom permalink for the rule in the format `/styles/{{title}}/`.

#### Content
Include the following in the markdown content:
1. A detailed description of what the CSS rule does.
2. Examples of how to use the rule, including HTML snippets styled by the CSS.
3. Additional notes or tips for developers.

### Example Output:
---
title: "Button Styling"
shortDescription: "Button styling for highlighting important actions."
tags: ["CSS", "Styles", "Selectors"]
selectors:
    - '.btn'
    - '.btn.btn-primary'
    - '.btn.btn-submit'
permalink: "/styles/button-styling.html"
---

## Button Styling

Then `.btn` rule defines the basic styling for buttons, and the `.btn-submit` rule defines the styling for submit buttons.

The `.btn-primary` rule defines the primary styling for buttons that should stand out, typically used for important calls to action like "Submit" or "Save."

## CSS Declarations

```css
.btn {
  border: 1px solid #007bff;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
.btn.btn-primary {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: #fff;
}

.btn.btn-submit {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
}
```

## Usage

Here's how to use this rule in your HTML:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button>
```


## Example

<div class="example-container">
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
    <button class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button>
</div>

## Developer Notes

- Use `.btn-primary` sparingly to maintain emphasis on important actions.
