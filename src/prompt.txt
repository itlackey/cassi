Create a detailed style guide for the following CSS based on the instructions and example output below:

## CSS
```css
{{cssText}}
```

## Instructions:
Create a markdown file formatted as follows:

### Front Matter

Add front matter compatible with 11ty, including:
- `title`: A friendly and descriptive title for the rule.
- `shortDescription`: A concise description of what the rule does.
- `tags`: An array of tags such as `['button', '.btn-primary', 'button:hover']`
- `filename`: A slugified filename based on the title.

It is VERY important that the front matter is correctly formatted and includes all required fields. 
It **MUST** include `---` before and after the YAML properties of the front matter.
Failure to include these fields or properly wrap the front matter YAML with `---` will result in errors when using 11ty. 

Here is an example of properly formatted front matter:

```markdown
---
title: "Button Styling"
shortDescription: "Button styling for highlighting important actions."
tags: [<string array of related tags>]
filename: "<slugified filename>"
---
```

### Content

Include the following in the markdown content:
1. A detailed description of what the CSS rule does.
2. Examples of how to use the rule, including HTML snippets styled by the CSS.
3. Additional notes or tips for developers.

### Example Output:
---
title: "Button Styling"
shortDescription: "Button styling for highlighting important actions."
tags: ["button", "submit", "primary", "btn", "btn-primary", "btn-submit"]
filename: "button-styling.md"
---

## Button Styling

Then `.btn` rule defines the basic styling for buttons, and the `.btn-submit` rule defines the styling for submit buttons.

The `.btn-primary` rule defines the primary styling for buttons that should stand out, typically used for important calls to action like "Submit" or "Save."


## Usage

Here's how to use this rule in your HTML:

<pre>
<code class="language-html">
&lt;button class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Primary&lte;/button&gt;
&lt;button class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Primary&lte;/button&gt;
</code>
</pre>


## Example

<div class="example-container">
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
    <button class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button>
</div>

## Developer Notes

- Use `.btn-primary` sparingly to maintain emphasis on important actions.
