Create a detailed style guide for the following CSS based on the instructions and example output below:

## CSS
```css
{{cssText}}
```

## Instructions:
Create a markdown file formatted as follows:

### Front Matter

Add front matter compatible with 11ty, including:
- `title`: A friendly and descriptive title for the rule.
- `shortDescription`: A concise description of what the rule does.
- `category`: The category under which this rule should be listed (e.g., 'Layout', 'Typography','Buttons', 'Components', 'Controls').
- `tags`: An array of tags such as `['button', '.btn-primary', 'button-hover']`

It is VERY important that the front matter is correctly formatted and includes all required fields. 
It **MUST** include `---` before and after the YAML properties of the front matter.
Failure to include these fields or properly wrap the front matter YAML with `---` will result in errors when using 11ty. 

Here is an example of properly formatted front matter:

```markdown
---
title: "Button Styling"
shortDescription: "Button styling for highlighting important actions."
category: Buttons
tags: [<string array of related tags>]
---
```

### Content

Include the following in the markdown content:
1. A detailed description of what the CSS rule does.
2. Examples of how to use the rule, including HTML snippets styled by the CSS.
3. Additional notes or tips for developers.
