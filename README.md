Cassi is an innovative tool that generates markdown-based documentation for your CSS files using AI. Whether you're managing a legacy codebase or building new projects, Cassi simplifies the process of creating a comprehensive and customizable CSS style guide.

## Why Cassi?

Maintaining CSS documentation can be a tedious and time-consuming task, especially for large projects with hundreds of rules. Existing tools often fall short:

- Many are outdated and haven't been updated in years.
- Component-focused tools like Storybook aren't designed for plain CSS styles.
- Refactoring or modifying CSS just to document it is often not feasible.

Cassi bridges this gap by analyzing your existing CSS files and using AI to generate readable, actionable, and fully customizable markdown documentation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Markdown Generation**  
  Cassi parses your CSS files and generates markdown documentation for each rule, complete with examples and developer notes.

- **Customizable Templates**  
  Modify the prompt template to tailor the documentation style to your needs.

- **11ty-Compatible Output**  
  Includes front matter with properties like `title`, `tags`, `permalink`, `shortDescription`, and `selectors`, making integration with 11ty and other static site generators seamless.

- **Runs Locally or in the Cloud**  
  Use open-source models locally or integrate with hosted AI services like OpenAI.

- **Simple Setup**  
  Quickly integrate Cassi into your workflow with minimal configuration.

## Installation

To get started with Cassi, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itlakey/cassi.git
cd cassi
npm install
```

## Run The Example

Now that the depenedencies are installed, you can run the example by executing the following command in the project directory:

`npm run example`

## Example Output

Examples can be found in the `examples/output` directory. Each file corresponds to a CSS rule found in `examples/styles` directory.

## Usage

1. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables. Update the values as needed based on your setup.

   ```plaintext
    OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="ollama"
    CASSI_MODEL_NAME="qwen2.5-coder:latest"
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Files**  
   - Place your CSS files in a directory that Cassi can read.
   - **Optionally** Create a prompt template file or customize the existing prompt template in `src/prompt.txt`.

3. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script with the glob patterns for your CSS files and the path to your prompt file:

   ```bash
   node --env-file=.env index.js "./styles/**/*.css"
   ```

4. **View the Output**

   Cassi generates markdown files in the specified output directory. Each file includes:
   - A detailed description of the CSS rule.
   - Usage examples in HTML.
   - Developer notes for clarity and guidance.

## Use Cases

Cassi can help you with various use cases, including:

- **Legacy CSS Projects**: Generate documentation for unmodifiable stylesheets.
- **Style Guide Generator**: Integrate markdown output directly into 11ty or similar tools to create a living style guide.
- **Team Documentation**: Provide clear, standardized documentation for large teams.

## What's Next for Cassi?

Cassi was built to solve a problem I was facing. Now that I can easily generate the documentation I need, I am considering a few more features to improve Cassi's capabilities.

Here are some features I am considering adding:

- **11ty Starter Kit** - A pre-configured 11ty project that includes Cassi and is pre-configured to generate a style guide from the files created by Cassi.
- **Proper CLI** to allow syntax like `cassi generate styles/*.css --output-dir docs` for generating documentation or `cassi build` to generate a style guide using 11ty.
- **Incremental Updates** - Add logic to allow Cassi to determine what CSS has been added/modified, and add/update the markdown documents accordingly.
- **Style Grouping** - Allow users to group CSS rules into categories or sections for easier navigation.
