# .section-title Styling

The `.section-title` CSS rule defines a flexible design pattern for section titles. This is typically used at the start of sections to display title text in an appealing, centered manner that adjusts according to screen size and layout requirements.

## CSS Declarations
```css
.section-title {
  color: var(--fourth-accent);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  position: relative;
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

### Key Features:

- **Color Sync**: Integrates with custom CSS variables (like `--fourth-accent`), allowing easy theme consistency and adjustments.
- **Flexibility**: Uses `display: flex;` to enable central alignment (`justify-content: center;`) for a visually balanced look across different screen sizes, ensuring the title is always centered on the viewport.
- **Responsive Width**: Specifies `width: 100%;` for the section title container to fully stretch and occupy space horizontally, aiding in a responsive layout that adapts to various display dimensions.
- **Relative Positioning**: Utilizes `position: relative;`, enabling further positioning adjustments without disrupting the default flow of document elements.

## Usage

To use `.section-title` effectively within your web pages, you can apply it directly onto heading tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) or other containers housing section titles. Here's a simple example:

<div class="section-title">
  <h1>Welcome to Our Section</h1>
</div>

This HTML snippet will ensure that any content inside the `.section-title` div, particularly the `<h1>` tag, adheres to all styling rules defined by `.section-title`, centralizing it on the page and utilizing the specified color theme.

## Developer Tips

- To extend this rule further, consider combining it with media queries for even more dynamic adjustments on smaller screens or devices. For instance, you might want to increase the font size of titles in mobile views to improve readability.
- Keep consistency across your site by maintaining a uniform scheme with your project's other color variables when using `.section-title`. This fosters an overall aesthetic cohesion throughout the web experience.

By understanding and applying the principles behind the `.section-title` rule, developers can craft visually appealing and responsive designs that enhance user flow and engagement on websites.
