## Input and Select Focus Styling

This CSS rule set ensures that when an `<input>` or `<select>` element is in focus, it is clearly indicated to the user. This improves accessibility by making sure users know which element they can interact with next.

The `:focus` and `:focus-visible` pseudo-classes are used to target elements that have focus. The `:focus-visible` class appears only on browsers that support it, providing a better indication of where one can currently interact in cases where a keyboard is being used.

### CSS Declarations

```css
input:focus,
input:focus-visible,
select:focus,
select:focus-visible {
  outline-width: 0;
  border-color: var(--fourth-accent);
  accent-color: var(--fourth-accent);
}
```

#### Key Points:

- **`outline-width: 0;`** removes the default focus outline making it easier to style. This ensures that your custom styles, like `border-color` and `accent-color`, are more pronounced.
  
- The use of **CSS custom properties (`--fourth-accent`)** allows for easy theme customization across your application.

### Usage

When using these rules in your web components or HTML forms, you simply ensure these classes are correctly applied to inputs and selects. In most forms, the default appearance is already focused-friendly, but enhancing it with a custom accent color ensures consistency with other branded styles.

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Focus this input...">
<select>
  <option>A</option>
  <option>B</option>
</select>
```

### Developer Tips

- **Accessibility:** Consider user testing or accessibility reviews to ensure your focus indicators are effective for all users.
  
- **Consistency:** Keep the `accent-color` consistent across your UI toolkit (including buttons, inputs, selects) to maintain coherence.

This styling is crucial for ensuring that interactions in your web application are clear and accessible. By focusing on a distinct border and accent color for inputs and select elements when they receive focus, you're guiding users through an intuitive navigation experience.
